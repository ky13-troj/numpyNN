# Neural Network Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of a feedforward neural network using Python and NumPy. The neural network is designed to have customizable layers with sigmoid activation functions.

## Files Included

- `neural_network.py`: Contains the implementation of the `NeuralNetwork` class, including methods for creating layers, performing forward propagation, and applying the sigmoid activation function.
- `main.py`: Demonstrates how to use the `NeuralNetwork` class to create a neural network, define layers, provide input data, and obtain the final output.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and NumPy installed.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the files.

### Running the Example

To run the example provided in `main.py`:

```bash
python main.py

```

### Customize

You can customize the neural network by modifying the weights, biases, number of layers, and activation functions in the main.py file. Additionally, you can explore the NeuralNetwork class in neural_network.py to understand how the network is structured and make further modifications as needed.
